The Hello World Project!

This is a message about nothing. Nothing is interesting in that it describes itself in principle but negates itself in practice. Nothing is something. Nothing is a word. Nothing is a noun. Nothing is confusing. Nothing is wrong. Nothing is right. Nothing is better than... Nothing is worse than... You get the idea. Nothing always is. Something.
